## Tips for Creating Signs with Win PC Sign Basic 2012
 
Creating signs with Win PC Sign Basic 2012 is easy and fun, but there are some tips and tricks that can help you make your signs even better. Here are some of them:

- Choose the right vinyl material for your project. There are different types of vinyl, such as glossy, matte, metallic, reflective, fluorescent, etc. Each one has its own advantages and disadvantages, depending on the purpose and location of your sign. For example, glossy vinyl is more durable and resistant to fading, but it can also reflect light and cause glare. Matte vinyl is less shiny and more suitable for indoor use, but it can also scratch more easily.
- Use the right blade and settings for your vinyl cutter. Different vinyl materials require different blades and settings to cut them properly. For example, thicker vinyl may need a deeper cut and more pressure than thinner vinyl. You can adjust these settings in Win PC Sign Basic 2012 by clicking on the Cutter menu and selecting Options. You can also test your settings by cutting a small sample before cutting your whole design.
- Use weeding boxes and mirror mode to save time and vinyl. Weeding boxes are small rectangles that surround your design and make it easier to peel off the excess vinyl. Mirror mode is a feature that flips your design horizontally so that you can cut it on the back side of the vinyl. This way, you don't have to flip the vinyl manually after cutting it. You can enable these features in Win PC Sign Basic 2012 by clicking on the Cutter menu and selecting Weeding Box or Mirror Mode.
- Use text effects and color themes to enhance your design. Win PC Sign Basic 2012 has a variety of text effects and color themes that you can apply to your text and shapes. For example, you can add shadows, outlines, gradients, textures, etc. to your text to make it stand out. You can also choose from different color themes that match your design or create your own custom colors. You can access these features in Win PC Sign Basic 2012 by clicking on the Text menu and selecting Effects or Color Theme.
- Use real textures and mockups to preview your sign. Win PC Sign Basic 2012 has a library of real textures and mockups that you can use to see how your sign will look like on different surfaces and backgrounds. For example, you can see how your sign will look like on a wall, a window, a car, a shirt, etc. You can access these features in Win PC Sign Basic 2012 by clicking on the View menu and selecting Texture or Mockup.

With these tips and tricks, you can create professional signs with Win PC Sign Basic 2012 in no time. Have fun and be creative!
